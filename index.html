    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>If you and this dye were playing hide and seek, you would win every time, because this dye is everywhere! It is
      so common that a 2023 report from Amen Clinics stated that 6,000,000 pounds of red dye is used in products so far
      this year.
      <br><br>

      Like many other children in schools across the country, I have been adversely affected by Red Dye 40. This common
      food additive is widely used in food served in our schools, including lunches, which is causing distressing health
      issues in students, including myself.
      <br><br>
      Red Dye 40, an artificial food dye, has been linked to hyperactivity in children as well as immune system tumors,
      according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). Despite these alarming facts, it is still
      regularly used in foods that our children consume daily at school. It's high time we question if the color and
      appeal of food are more important than the wellbeing of our kids.
      <br><br>
      In Europe, products that contain Red Dye 40 are required to carry warnings stating that consumption could lead to
      hyperactivity in children (Per the Food Regulations 2010). Yet in the United States, we still allow our schools to
      use this harmful additive without any warning. This is both an inadequate and unjust practice, especially when
      children's health is at stake.
      <br><br>
      We demand that schools nationwide cease the use of Red Dye 40 in their lunches. Kids deserve healthier and safer
      meal options. Let's prioritize their well-being over colorful food. Sign this petition to protect our children
      from potentially harmful additives. Let's bring about a change in the food served in our schools.
